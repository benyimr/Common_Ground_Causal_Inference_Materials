# Recitation Slides — Causal Inference (6.S059 / 15.C08 / 17.C08)

Spring 2024 — MIT Department of Political Science, MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, and MIT Sloan School of Management

This repository contains recitation slides I prepared and delivered (with Licheng Liu) for  
Causal Inference (6.S059 / 15.C08 / 17.C08), taught in Spring 2024 by Professors Joseph Doyle, Roberto Rigobon, and Teppei Yamamoto.

The recitations complement the course’s lectures and provide applied walkthroughs, examples, and clarifications of selected topics in modern causal inference.

Slides are organized by week in separate folders.  
Google Colab notebooks accompanying some recitations are available [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uCnzdo5aS7pynd38dbDzZ5euFMSpdHY_?usp=drive_link)


## Course Context

This course provides an accessible overview of modern quantitative methods for causal inference.  
The recitations covered topics such as:

- Potential outcomes and causal graphs  
- Randomized controlled trials  
- Observational studies and selection bias  
- Instrumental variables  
- Regression discontinuity  
- Difference-in-differences and panel data methods  
- Connections and contrasts with machine learning approaches  

These materials were designed to support enrolled students and should be interpreted as supplemental, not standalone instructional content.
